I recently earned my technicians license and immediately purchased my new shiny callsign as a domain name. Currently, I'm not so much making QSO's as much as listening to familiarize myself with NYC area repeaters.

I intend to post what I learn as a ham in this space, which, so far, is how to build software from source on Linux machines and the trials of programming various radios ;)
