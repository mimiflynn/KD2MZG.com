## Programming with Windows VM

I've found that I can only program this radio with a Windows VM, but I have not tried to program it with Wine on Ubuntu.

The cable is a little funny on these so you will have to click on the USB icon in the bottom of VirtualBox and select the USB device and listen to Windows 10 to confirm if it has connected.

If you select the USB device and do not hear the happy Windows USB connected chime, turn off the radio all the way then back on and it may connect better that way.

## Programming both RF and Digital frequencies

## Installing hacked firmware

Gotta be familiar with the command line.
