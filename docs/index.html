          <section class="content"><p>The end of this crazy year has finally come. What a ride. This year, I have a few accomplishments of&nbsp;note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technician amateur radio&nbsp;license</li>
<li>Learned to&nbsp;sail</li>
<li>Motorcycle&nbsp;license</li>
</ul>
<p>Next year, I plan&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amateur Extra&nbsp;license</li>
<li>Learn morse&nbsp;code</li>
<li><a href="http://ve3bux.com/?page_id=501">Configure an Ardiuno to talk to my&nbsp;<span class="caps">FT</span>-857D</a></li>
<li><span class="caps">DX</span>&nbsp;contacts</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sota.org.uk/"><span class="caps">SOTA</span></a></li>
<li>Learn more about&nbsp;microcontrollers</li>
<li>Build an&nbsp;amp</li>
<li><a href="http://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/">HackRF&nbsp;lessons</a></li>
<li>probably random stuff I never thought of because radio is cool like&nbsp;that</li>
</ul>
<p>Through adventures in radio, this year I became more comfortable building software from source code, using Linux full time, and talking about my tech knowledge. The last point is an interesting development since I’ve worked as a developer for almost my entire adult life. I rarely spoke to people about my tech projects outside of work (aka in my comfort zone with people I know), but the community around radio is really nice and encouraging of communication. Since we are all amateurs, we are all learning how we can and are at different levels of knowledge. I will always need to work on talking about tech, as its easy to come off as snobby in this field, and I’m happy to be around good encouraging&nbsp;people.</p>
